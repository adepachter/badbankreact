# Bad Bank with React and Firebase auth
## _a - not very well functioning - app_


Following the MERN-stack bootcamp from MIT|xPro and that is how this application started its life. This is an exercise intended for learning purposes.
Some things this exercise should do and learn us about:

- HTML/CSS/JS
- ReactJS with use of Context
- Express server
- Node.js
- Google Firebase
- DAL

## Install guide

- Copy the https:// link from above
- in a new terminal window type and paste: 
```
git clone https://...
```
- install dependencies using 
```
npm install
```
- start application from terminal with 
```
node index.js
```

## Features 

You should be able to authenticate logging in using Firebase, and creating an account in the Firebase authentication database. All data will also be saved in the MongoDB database, but won't be used to check logging in users. 

Be aware this app is a test, and no valid data should be entered!

- Creating a user
- Loggin in as a user
- Deposit some money on your account (still need to add authentication)
- Withdraw some money from your account (still need to add authentication)
- Check your balance
- See all users data

In the future I would like to authenticate using self-built JWT tokens, I don't like Firebase that much.
